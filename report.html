    <h1>Report <small>Alistair Wick AW12700</small></h1>

    <h2>Idea</h2>
    <p><em>PixL</em> is a simple platform for sharing, rating and discussing visual media, including 3D models and images. It is designed to be accessed from
    both desktop and mobile browsers, displaying interactive in-browser 3D content where WebGL features are supported; I felt this would provide a sufficient
    technical challenge for the assignment, and it caters to my personal interest in 3D modelling and rendering.</p>

    <p>I wanted to create a ratings system similar to Reddit or Imgur's collective user voting, where each user gets one "up" or "down" vote per item. This 
    approach has been shown to work well for maximising visibility of the best content, and offers some degree of user participation to help create a community
    which will come back regularly for more. Something akin to Reddit's comment system would also help in this regard, again with user voting to drive the best
    comments to the top.</p>


    <h2>Implementation</h2>

    <h3>General</h3>
    <p>The site is implemented using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Twitter Bootstrap</a>. My research showed it was the most flexible and widely-used 
    framework currently available, and it supported the use of jQuery, which I was already somewhat familiar with. This proved to be a good choice - the framework
    was very easy to get started with, and the wide usage of the technology meant that most of my questions had already been asked. The responsive grid system
    proved key in page layout, and allowed the site to work smoothly on a wide range of screen sizes.</p>

    <h3><a href="index.html">Front page 3D view</a></h3>
    <p>This was a focus for me, and took up much of the development time. I first experimented with getting a bare minimum 3D display into the page, with just a 
    static wireframe cube. Using <a href="http://threejs.org">Three.js</a> made this quite straightforward.</p>
    <p>I decided early on that I would want to display interactive DOM content over the 3D view, so this was something I experimented with for some time. DOM
    elements can't be added to a canvas for security reasons, and although <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Drawing_DOM_objects_into_a_canvas">
    non-trivial workarounds</a> do exist, they aren't necessarily widely supported. The solution I settled on turned out to be quite simple: the 3D canvas view
    is inserted into an absolutely-positioned element fixed at the start of the page, which is therefore absent from the normal document flow. I was then able
    to create and position the other elements as normal, with the 3D view as a kind of background. This seemed more elegant than another solution where I pulled
    the overlay element up and over the 3D view, and as a bonus it worked well with Bootstrap's responsive layout (which the other solution did not). I was surprised
    to see that modern browsers are quite happy to display these elements with proper alpha blending: the shadow effect around the 3D view is actually created by CSS
    in the overlay, and not by the view itself.</p>
    <p>For obvious reasons, the 3D view isn't supported on old browsers, notably IE8. For the final site I intend to display a static image of the 3D model whenever
    WebGL is unavailable. For now, the space is left blank and the associated scripts fail without creating other issues on the page.</p>

    <h2>Future Work</h2>
    <p>I've spent enough time on this feature to justify leaving it as-is for this interim release. The final viewer will be interactive, with rotation and zoom. I'd
    also like to implement some kind of progressive streaming of models from the server, to get <em>something</em> displayed on the user's screen as soon as possible
    after page load - for example, streaming the geometric mesh data and displaying each triangle as soon as it becomes available, followed by materials/shaders and 
    finally texture images.</p>


    <h3>CSS Styling</h3>
    <p>The site makes heavy use of custom CSS styling on almost every element. The intention here was to customize the look and feel to separate it visually from Bootstrap's
    base theme. I went for a dark, flat look so as not to distract from content on the site, which should always remain the focus of the user's attention.
