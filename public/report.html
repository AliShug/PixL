somewhat similar in design to image sharing sites 
like Imgur. The site allows anonymous or registered 
users to upload 3D models in .FBX format, a widely 
supported export format. The models can have a 
searchable description and tag-set attached, 
and are sorted by their tags into categories called 
'channels'.</p><p>Registered users can make comments on models on the 
site, and can delete their own models if they so choose 
(anonymously uploaded models can only be removed by 
an admin account). Admins can select a model for 
prominent display on the landing page, in the 'featured' 
section. This displays a full 3D view of the model to 
visitors.</p><p>The site utilizes a variety of client and server-side 
technologies, including WebGL & Three.js for rendering, 
and Node, Express and MongoDB at the back-end.
</p><h2>Server Implementation</h2><h3>Jade Templating</h3><p>Before getting into the details of the server implementation, 
I should mention that the site has been converted to use 
Jade templating (dynamic html generation) throughout. This 
allows content to be inserted and adjusted on the pages with 
a great degree of freedom, using familiar JS-compatible code: 
for example, search results are displayed using a loop within 
the template document, and various controls are hidden or 
shown based on a user's access permissions.</p><h3>File Upload and Processing</h3><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><p>Files are uploaded using the form shown below. This uses 
the standard multipart/form format through HTTP POST, parsed by 
the 'multer' express middleware, which writes the file to an 
'uploads' directory on the server. The name, description, tags 
and logged-in user (if any) are stored in the server's MongoDB 
database with a unique item ID, which is used to identify the 
model in HTTP requests. All of these fields are text-indexed, 
allowing full search functionality with relevance-sorting. 
A limit on the number of tags is enforced on both the client and 
server sides (as the client protection can be trivially bypassed).</p><a href="http://pixl.alistairwick.com/upload"><img src="report-images/upload.png" class="img-responsive"></a><p>FBX files hold mesh data including vertex and face definitions, 
and are a commonly used format for 3D data exchange. I knew 
when starting the project that an SDK for working with the files 
was freely available, which made it an even easier choice.</p><p>The FBX SDK provided by Autodesk provides python bindings, which
allowed me to avoid dealing directly with native code and kept things 
relatively portable - although the library files included in my 
submission are linux-only, as I developed on Ubuntu. I used the 
python-shell package to run a conversion script server-side on any 
files which were uploaded, with the script being part of the three.js 
bundle.</p></div><div class="col-md-6"><img src="report-images/missile.png" class="img-responsive"><p>I ran into a few issues with getting the FBX SDK working, however. 
Different versions of python dealt differently with normal / double-
width encoded bytes, on top of the requirement for the x64 version of
the SDK. The SDK files also had to be manually added to the python 
path for execution, and weren't picked up in Python's site-packages 
directory. This issues were frustrating to debug and ended up costing 
me time I wanted to spend on more extensive file support: in theory, 
the conversion script also supported materials, textures, and both .obj 
and .dae file formats, but I wasn't able to experiment with these.</p><p>In retrospect, I might have been better off relying on a more open 
file format, and possibly even writing a converter for myself.</p></div></div><br><h3>User Signup and Login</h3><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><p>User accounts were part of my vision of the site from the start, 
and were an important feature to focus on for the server-side of 
development. Accounts can be freely created with just a name, email, 
screen-name and password, and user information is stored on the 
database. Users can modify their account email and password after 
creation, and can delete the models they've uploaded. Administrators 
can remove any model from the site, and can also select models for 
featuring on the front page. These abilities are implemented 
through an AJAX API, with features hidden from users who can't access 
them (and protected by authentication on the server end).</p><a href="http://pixl.alistairwick.com/login"><img src="report-images/login.png" class="img-responsive"></a><p>The form shown above allows users to log in to the site.</p><p>Account editing:</p><img src="report-images/user_edit.png" class="img-responsive"></div><div class="col-md-6"><p>Users see their own accounts differently (thanks to dynamic Jade 
templating). A logged-in user on her own account:</p><img src="report-images/user.png" class="img-responsive"><br><p>And viewing another user's account:</p><img src="report-images/user_noaccess.png" class="img-responsive"><p>The user's login information is stored on the server's database using 
express' 'session' middleware, along with the connect-mongo storage 
engine. This allows users to stay online for as long as they're 
browsing the site by storing a small identifying cookie on their browser. 
This cookie is matched up to a transient database entry once the user is 
logged in, with the database entry holding their user id. All requests 
to the server pass through a function which extracts the user's 
information from the database for use in authentication or template 
rendering.
</p></div></div><br><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><h3>Comments</h3><p>I implemented a simple commenting system for users to add thoughts 
on each others models. The client sends an AJAX request to the server, 
which appends a comment to the item's database document, then renders 
the comment html based on the comment template and returns this to the 
client, where it is dynamically added to the webpage. Future requests 
to the item page include the new comment(s) through the dynamic 
templating system.</p><p>Comments are labelled with the user who posted them - this cannot be 
faked, as it is authenticated on the server rather than sent with the 
request. While I had planned on nested comments, this would have 
required a more complex (and admittedly more robust) database schema 
which I ran out of time to develop, including a full comments collection 
(table) and relational links between comments. Note that instead I have 
used MongoDB's support for within-document (row) arrays; this places an 
upper limit on the number of comments per model, although this number is 
large. It may also have a minor impact on performance when adding new 
comments.</p></div><div class="col-md-6"><h3>Search</h3><p>The website's search functionality is robust, and is implemented through 
MongoDB's fast text-indexing feature. The name, author name, description 
and tags on a model are all searchable, with punctuation ignored and 
advanced features like phrase searching with "..." or exclusion with -....</p><p>The indexed search also provides a metadata 'ranking' field, allowing 
results to be sorted by decreasing relevance.
</p></div></div><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>There's a huge amount I'd still like to add to the site, but this is already a 
late submission! I wish I'd been able to spend more time on it, but all things 
considered I'm proud of what I've developed. The site is fairly robust, displays 
the models front and center - which is always what I intended, albeit originally 
with a little more flash - and I've gained some valuable experience working with 
Node and MongoDB on a deployed web-server, which I enjoyed much more than I 
thought I would. NPM makes trying out new technologies a breeze, and the open-source 
community really has thought of everything. The way Jade integrated so beautifully 
with Express, JavaScript and MongoDB documents was also wonderful - having worked 
with PHP/MySQL in the past, I can appreciate how much easier things were this time.</p></div></div></body></html>
